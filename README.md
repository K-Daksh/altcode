#### Introducing Altcode (formerly known as Qrrate): Your Gateway to Limitless Cloud Storage! ☁️

Altcode is an open-source web application built in Node.js, designed to transform your approach to file storage. It takes files of any format and ingeniously converts them into video files that can be seamlessly uploaded to YouTube. What's remarkable is that YouTube imposes no hard limits on the size of the files you can upload, effectively granting you unlimited cloud storage for your data.

#### Here's how Altcode works its ✨Magic ✨

- File Conversion: Altcode converts your files into video format, with a compression ratio of just __3.2x__ the original size. This minimal increase ensures efficient storage while maintaining a high success rate during the conversion process, reducing the risk of corruption.

- Reliability: Altcode is the result of continuous refinement, now in its impressive __4th edition__. This ensures the highest quality and reliability when converting your files into videos and back.

- Advanced Processing: Behind the scenes, Altcode harnesses the power of __JIMP__ for advanced image processing and relies on __FFMPEG__ and __FFMPEG-FLUENT__ for video processing, guaranteeing a seamless and efficient conversion process.

__Say goodbye to storage limitations and embrace the future of file management with Altcode.__


__Note:__ 'The deployed site does not have good enough processing abilities due to the platform used, please do not try to process files of size more than 50MBs, you can use the application on your machine for larger files'
